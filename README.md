# rm2scripts
Some utility scripts for the remarkable 2

switcher: helps you switch between fingerterm and xochitl, fingerterm is preferred in case there is a conflict
run: used to run commands from fingerterm, kills fingerterm and runs the required command with rm2fb-client
fingerterm-launcher: keeps track of fingerterm's pid and logs, to ensure it can be killed easily inside switcher

The scripts work fine for me on 2.5, I run switcher with genie to alternate between fingerterm and xochitl, and use fingerterm to launch any apps that I need.
Read the code and use if it seems reasonable to you.
